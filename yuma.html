            <p>The Yuma Territorial Prison is a former prison located in Yuma, Arizona, United States. Opened on July 1, 1876, and shut down on September 15th, 1909. It is one of the Yuma Crossing and Associated Sites on the National Register of historic places in the Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area. This prison was closed due to overcrowding and all inmates were moved to a new prison in Florence in 1909. The two most notable Inmates were Ricard Flores Magon, who established Partido Liberal Mexicano to oppose dictator Porfirio Diaz. And Pearl Hart, who robbed the globe to Florence with her partner, Joe Boot and is now known as the Bandit Queen.</p>
