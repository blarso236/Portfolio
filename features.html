        Cybernation is a store in which you can (and will) upgrade <br>
        your own body. Whether you want to get a new arm, a <br>
        better eye (that isn't fragile), or even get an implant <br>
        injected into your own bloodstream with your own custom <br>
        upgrades, you can find anything your body desires. The <br>
        future is not far from here, and it's time for the <br>
        Cybernation to rise.

        <h1 id="Money">Shipping Policies</h1><br>
        Creating this next level tech is expensive, but to ship all of <br>
        this, we here at Cybernation have to go through with <br>
        picking the right size box and making sure it is in perfect <br>
        working condition so that this equipment doesn't <br>
        get damaged along the way. To keep everything in perfect <br>
        condition, our Shipping fees are a bit higher than average <br>
        at 12%.

      <button class="accordion">Return Warning</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <h1 id="important">WARNING!</h1>
        • Returning our products is not possible. <br>
        • If you don't like the cybernetic arm, it's not like we can just reattach your arm. <br>
        • Cybernetic enhancements to your eye from us can be reversed, but only if you are willing to endure surgery. <br>
        • Taking out nanomachines is a lot harder than you'd think, and can only be removed within the first 2 weeks after purchase. <br>

        <h1 id="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        • Q: So how are you supposed to move the arm now?<br>
        • A: You will have to use your mind to control your arm.<br>
          Doing so will feel weird at first, but once you get the grasp of things, you will not regret <strike>becoming another test subject</strike> your purchase!<br>
        • Q: Why does my arm never stop moving? It's getting annoying when I have to go to sleep.<br>
        • A: This is because you're indirectly telling it what to do. Try to think of things you can<br>
          do without it.<br>
        • Q: These Nanomachines are really painful! What can I do to make the process more tolerable?<br>
        • A: The most common way to make the pain go away is to take some painkillers. The first 24 hours<br>
        always hurt. However if you continue to feel pain after that, come to your nearest Cybernation. Hospitals can't even come close to seeing what's wrong.<br>
